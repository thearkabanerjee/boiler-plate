# Boilerplate VS Code Extension

A lightweight Visual Studio Code extension that quickly generates boilerplate code for different programming languages using simple trigger commands.

## Overview

This extension is designed to speed up development by eliminating the need to manually write repetitive starter code. By typing a short trigger (such as `!cpp`) inside a supported file, the extension inserts a ready-to-use boilerplate template.

## Features

* Instant boilerplate generation for multiple languages
* Simple trigger-based system (e.g., `!cpp`, `!js`, `!py`,`!ts`,`!c` and `!java`)
* Reduces setup time for new files
* Clean and minimal implementation for easy customization

## How It Works

1. Open a file in VS Code (for example, a `.cpp` file).
2. Type a trigger command such as:

   ```
   !cpp
   ```
3. The extension replaces the trigger with the corresponding boilerplate code.

## Supported Languages

* C++
* C
* JavaScript
* Python
* TypeScript
* Java

More languages can be added by extending the configuration.

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thearkabanerjee/boiler-plate.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project:

   ```
   cd (get-your-file-path-man)/boilerplate-extension
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install (gets you the node modules :)
   ```
4. Launch the extension: (incase you wanna test out)

   * Press `F5` or `fn + F5` for mac in VS Code to open a new Extension Development Host window

## Usage

* Open any supported file type
* Type the corresponding trigger
* Press Enter or trigger completion
* Boilerplate will be inserted automatically

## Customization

To add or modify boilerplates:

1. Open `extension.js`
2. Add a new trigger and template mapping
3. Reload the extension

## Development

To make changes:
